// parseTag parses a `url:"name[,modifier...]"` struct tag — the format
// shared by Encode and Decode. ok reports whether the field participates in
// wire mapping at all: a missing tag or "-" (matching encoding/json's skip
// convention) returns ok=false and the field is ignored by both functions.
//
// name is the tag's first (comma-separated) segment, exactly as written —
// callers that want Decode's long-standing "empty name falls back to the
// Go field name" behavior apply that themselves; Encode has never done so
// and this preserves that.
//
// Recognized modifiers, found anywhere after the name:
//   - "readonly": Encode never sends this field, even when it holds a
//     non-zero value. For fields that only ever appear in a GET response —
//     a server-computed digest, a rule's position, a resolved IP version —
//     this lets a single struct carry both the read and write shape of a
//     resource without risking a stale/read-only value leaking into a
//     write request when a caller builds Update options by copying a
//     previously-fetched struct.
//   - "writeonly": Decode never populates this field. For parameters that
//     only make sense on a write (a rename target, a delete-list) and
//     never appear in a GET response.
//   - "omitempty": accepted for symmetry with the sibling `json` tag, and
//     for readability. Encode already skips zero-valued, non-pointer
//     fields unconditionally, and Decode already skips absent JSON keys
//     unconditionally, so this modifier has no additional effect — it
//     documents the existing behavior rather than changing it.
//
// Unrecognized modifiers are ignored, so new ones can be introduced later
// without breaking existing tags.
//
// See docs/design.md §6 ("Read (X) vs. write (XOptions) structs: when to
// merge") for when a resource's read and write shapes are close enough to
// share one struct using these modifiers, versus when they should stay
// separate types.
